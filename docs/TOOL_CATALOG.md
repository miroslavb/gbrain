Every non-localOnly operation on the MCP surface: 136 tools across 23 areas. **Starter** marks membership in the ~39-op `starter` surface (`src/mcp/surface.ts`); **Gate** names the config key that must be true before remote callers see/call the op (`gbrain config set <key> true`). What a given token actually sees is further filtered per request by scope, bound-client fence, publish gates, and the per-client surface — see `docs/operations/mcp-surface-runbook.md`. Area names are non-contractual groupings.
